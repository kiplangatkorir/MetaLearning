# CPT-Based Geostratigraphy Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques, particularly meta-learning, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of geostratigraphy prediction using Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data. By addressing specific challenges and research gaps, we aim to enhance subsurface characterization and inform geotechnical decision-making.
